%h1 QUESTION 3:
%p Our troops are preparing for the BIG-DAY landing on the beaches of Sardinia (we thought the weather was nicer there).  For us to successfully land on the BIG-DAY, we need to know the enemy troop positions.  Lucky, one of our seductive SSPA agents, Madame Moth, has wooed a new machine away from under the nose of an enemy general.  The MARK IV (MARK III was canceled due to budget overruns) again builds off the design of the MARK II.  Except this time (drum roll please...) it has THREE wheels.
%p The MARK IV's third wheel is more complicated than the first two in that it's setting is based off the previously pressed character position.  The machine shifts the letter based off the first two wheels, then it further ADDS to the index TWO TIMES the PREVIOUS LETTER'S position in the machine's alphabet.  Note that the third wheel's initial position starts at 0.
%p You have a deadline to get this working before the BIG-DAY.  So get moving!
%p JSON question... using the first two wheel positions of 4,7 and an input message of 'The white cliffs of Alghero are visible at night', given the new 3rd variable wheel, what is the resulting output?
